### Skirmish with the Miko Fox - 2019

My largest programming project so far, albeit unfinished. A [Touhou Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touhou_Project)-styled game written using the C-like language [Danmakufu ph3](https://dmf.shrinemaiden.org/wiki/Main_Page). I started making individual scripts using Danmakufu in August of 2018, and started working on a more unified game in January of 2019. Ever since then I have been adding small bits here and there to the game during my spare time. As of August 2019, this project has been discontinued due to a lack of assets critical to this project's success.
