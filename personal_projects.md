### Project "Blademancer" - 2021

With GameMaker Studio's 2.3 update, tons of new IDE and language features were introduced to the engine. I decided to take this opportunity to develop a small prototype for a top-down combat-based game with the unique mechanic of "the player can telekinetically control bladed weapons". This prototype was created as mostly a sandbox to experiment with some of GMS 2.3's new features, but if the concept is received well I may build it into something bigger (maybe a roguelike?).

#### Screenshots and itch.io link coming soon

### Chimerarms - 2020

My submission for the game jam [Miz Jam 1](https://itch.io/jam/miz-jam-1), where entrants have 48 hours to creat a game using the [Kenney 1-Bit Pack](https://kenney.nl/assets/bit-pack) art pack for the game's graphics. I saw the art pack's various sprites for fantasy-style weapons and came up with an idea of mashing them together to create combinations of weapons that share some attributes from the weapons used to make them. It was a little challenging to scale the difficulty of the game with the random natures of the enemy spawns, but I was content with what I had submitted at the time of the deadline.

### Project "Lila" - Since 2019

Based on an Fantasy Action RPG idea I've had for several years, I worked with [c0linw](https://github.com/c0linw) and [MichaelXian](https://github.com/MichaelXian) to develop a game based on this idea. We used this project to learn about the GameMaker engine and experiment with implementing various RPG elements, such as experience, combat, and inventory, using GameMaker Studio 2. We plan to eventually turn Project Lila into a full-fledged game, but we are still in the process of learning more about GameMaker Studio 2 (especially with the recent 2.3 update), and game development in general.

### Skirmish with the Miko Fox - 2019

One of my largest programming projects, albeit unfinished. A [Touhou Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touhou_Project)-styled game written using the C-like language [Danmakufu ph3](https://dmf.shrinemaiden.org/wiki/Main_Page). I started making individual scripts using Danmakufu in August of 2018, and started working on a more unified game in January of 2019. Ever since then I have been adding small bits here and there to the game during my spare time. As of August 2019, this project has been discontinued due to a lack of assets critical to this project's success.
