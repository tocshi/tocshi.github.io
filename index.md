# About Me

I'm a 2nd year Computer Science major studying at the University of British Columbia.
I'm also a video game enthusiast, and a digital artist. I have plans to work a 3D Action RPG using Unity in the near future, after I finish my current personal project.

## Personal Projects

### Skirmish with the Miko Fox

My pride and joy. A [Touhou Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touhou_Project)-styled game written using the C-like language [Danmakufu ph3](https://dmf.shrinemaiden.org/wiki/Main_Page). I started making individual scripts using Danmakufu in August of 2018, and started working on a more unified game in January of 2019. Ever since then I have been adding small bits here and there to the game during my spare time. As of May 2019, the game is still largely unfinished, with my current priorities being finishing up unfinished levels before moving on to replacing the placeholder sprites, adding sounds, and retrofitting the user interface.

## Academic Projects
<br>
### Image Classifier Using Bag-of-Words

A project for my Computer Vision course where I used Python to train a database to form a vocabulary of "visual words," a series of image features that correspond to certain objects that help in identifying said objects. I then used two of Python Scikit's classifier algorithms, a [k-nearest-neighbors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm) classifier and a [support vector machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support-vector_machine) classifier, to attempt to identify the contents of sample images. Unfortunately, the only easily presentable results of this process that I was able to produce are in the form of [confusion matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confusion_matrix), which are shown below.

### Automatically Generated Texture Synthesis

A project for my Computer Vision course where I used Python to demonstrate the [Efros and Leung method](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~efros/research/EfrosLeung.html) of texture synthesis. Simply put, it fills in a portion of an image with a sample texture from a different part of the image, using a comparison of the sum of squared differences between the to the fill area and the sample texture to determine how the texture is generated. This allows the resultant texture fill to look as natural as possible. I tested this process on multiple images, two of which are shown below.
