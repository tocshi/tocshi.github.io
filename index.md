# About Me

I'm a 2nd year Computer Science major studying at the University of British Columbia.
I'm also a video game junkie, and a digital artist. I have plans to work a 3D Action RPG using Unity in the near future, after I finish my current personal project.

## Personal Projects

### Skirmish with the Miko Fox

My pride and joy. A [Touhou Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touhou_Project)-styled game written using the C-like language [Danmakufu ph3](https://dmf.shrinemaiden.org/wiki/Main_Page). I started making individual scripts using Danmakufu in August of 2018, and started working on a more unified game in January of 2019. Ever since then I have been adding small bits here and there to the game during my spare time. As of May 2019, the game is still largely unfinished, with my current priorities being finishing up unfinished levels before moving on to replacing the placeholder sprites, adding sounds, and retrofitting the user interface.
